# EE_2.03_Phy2_WS2021_II_Exam_Group_XX

## General Infos, Exam Only Repository

1. Due date is 2022-03-31.
1. You can deregister from the exam until 2022-02-28.
1. You can work in groups of two students or alone.
1. Assign yourself to a [**Moodle Group**](https://moodle.hochschule-rhein-waal.de/mod/choicegroup/view.php?id=362611), even if you are working alone.
1. Download (not clone) this repo and **rename the folder according to your moodle group**, e.g. rename `EE_2.03_Phy2_WS2021_II_Exam_Group_XX` to `EE_2.03_Phy2_WS2021_II_Exam_Group_Z`, if your Moodle group is `Z`.   
1. Create **your own HSRW gitlab repository** from the downloaded and renamed directory tree, i.e. create a HSRW gitlab repository named `EE_2.03_Phy2_WS2021_II_Exam_Group_Z` from your local folder if your Moodle group is `Z`.
1. Make the gitlab repo **PRIVATE** to avoid copy and paste from others. It is enough if **one member of the group provides the group repo**. The owner of the repo can invite the other group members to collaborate and to grant push rights to them. 
1. **Grant read access to the supervisors (professors, assistants, etc.) on your repository!** Otherwise we cannot download your repo and **we cannot grade it!**
1. **Strictly follow the naming conventions for your HSRW gitlab group repo!** At due date the supervisors will search for the repo names and download them. If you choose another name or if you do not invite us for reading we will not be able to find the repo: it is as if you had not submitted your assignment and **we cannot grade it!**
1. **You have to use Jupyter notebooks for all your calculations!** We must be able to redo your calculations from the Jupyter notebook! 
1. **Describe in the Jupyter notebook what you are doing!** Just providing code is not enough! **Use markdown cells and appropriate formatting** to add your descriptive text.
